A repo to try the tutorial

I think this is really starting to make sense!

I make a branch, and that is what I work on.
So maybe, a "bug fixes" branch
and a "features" branch
So I could work [primarily? exclusively?] in one or the other when I'm working on that type of problem
  It seems like it could help reduce not-finish-itis.
